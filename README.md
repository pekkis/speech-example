## Howto

### Develop

- `npm install`
- `cp .env.example .env`
- `npm run start`

Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (if that is reserved for some reason, you might get another port but the terminal should tell you that). You should see a "beautiful" welcoming
screen that contains a duckling and suggests that some people like suckling on ducklings.

There should be some helpful instructions / assertions on the screen. Please look at it carefully. If you're happy with what you see, you're done.

### Build

- `npm run build`

Look at the `dist/`
